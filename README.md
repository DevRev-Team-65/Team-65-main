This library is an implementation of the problem statement

## Components

- `OpenAIEmbeddings`: This is used to generate embeddings for the functions.
- `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`: This is used to generate embeddings for the functions.
- `ChatOpenAI`: This is a chat model from the Langchain library that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model.

## Retrievers

- `VectorStoreRetriever`: This is used to find functions that are similar to the query.
- `LlamaIndexRetriever`: This is used to find functions that are similar to the query.
- `CustomContextualCompressionRetriever`: This is used to find functions that are similar to the query.
- `CustomMultiQueryRetriever`: This is used to find functions that are similar to the query.

## Composers

- `ChainOfThoughtComposer`: This is used to generate an answer based on the query and the retrieved functions.
- `TreeOfThoughtComposer`: This is used to generate an answer based on the query and the retrieved functions.

## Output Parser

- `ToolOutputParser`: This is used to parse the output generated by the composer.
